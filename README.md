# Roblox-BallparkDefender

## Summary

This repo serves as the backup location for my [Roblox game Ballpark Defender](https://roblox.com/games/12117545162/Ballpark-Defender) - a Tower Defense game with a baseball theme. Mobs invade a local ballpark and you have to strategically place 10 defenders to keep the ballpark from being destroyed.

Credit to Youtuber [GnomeCode](https://www.youtube.com/@GnomeCode) for his excellent [22 Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DanjB0cTfw0&list=PLtMUa6NlF10fEF1WOeDtuGcIn0RdUNL7c) on how to build a complete Tower Defense game on Roblox. I learned almost everything in this codebase from that tutorial, and tailored it to fit my needs for this game.
